# Deep-Learner
> sweat and blood converted to tutorials

## Introduction

Hi there, I am Jimmy Yeh and I am studying Deep Learning for my Master's Degree at National Taiwan University. Over the past semesters I've often had to fight through various technical difficulties and pitfalls to get a deep learning model to work. It all seem simple in theory, but in practices there are just so many ways it could go wrong. To celebrate my journey and to lend a helping hand to other fellow sojourners on this voyage to conquer Deep Learning, I present to you this repository as a guide for the beginners.
